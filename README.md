# About Me
Hello! My name is Cara Cai and I live in Shanghai, China. I work hard on going out of my comfort zone and stretching myself. I have a lot of hobbies such as doing sports and listening to music. I am also a volleyball player. My college life has begun in NYU Shanghai with the goal of learning new things and meeting more friends.

I'm a freshman of NYU Shanghai, China's first Sino-American university. And my high school is Weiyu High School in Xuhui District. Currently I'm interested in IMA/IMB so I chose Application Lab as my elective course. And I am thinking about learning music theories and commanding new skills so I chose songwriting as another elective course.

 I pride myself on my ability to take risks to challenge myself. I work hard and I am trying to work more efficiently.  I know enough about volleyball stuff because I played for Xuhui District as a professional teenage player. However,I know nothing about programming and have no experiences. I think it's ok because I believe in my professors as well as myself.
